## Challenge

Job seekers struggle with creating personalized cover letters that effectively match their background to specific company values and job requirements, often resulting in generic applications that fail to stand out.

**Key Issues:**
- Generic cover letters that don't reflect company research
- Time-consuming manual customization for each application
- Difficulty aligning personal values with company mission
- No systematic way to improve and iterate on applications

## Solution

I built TrueFit, an intelligent LangGraph-based AI agent that combines long-term memory, company research, and dual LLM systems to generate and review personalized cover letters with contextual precision.

**Core AI Capabilities:**
- **üß† Long-term Memory:** Stores user values, interests, and resume data using TrustCall
- **üè¢ Company Intelligence:** Automated extraction of company mission, values, and job details
- **üîé Tavily-powered RAG:** Dynamic web search to enrich missing company context
- **‚úçÔ∏è Contextual Generation:** Merges personal profile with company data for tailored letters
- **üîÑ Dual LLM Review:** GPT-4o for generation, Claude Sonnet for scoring and feedback
- **üõ†Ô∏è LangGraph Architecture:** Composable workflow with full traceability and debugging

**Technical Implementation:**
Python, LangGraph, LangSmith, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, Tavily API, TrustCall
