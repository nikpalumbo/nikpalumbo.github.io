## Challenge

Individual investors struggle to navigate the overwhelming landscape of ETFs, with thousands of options and complex financial documents that are difficult to parse and compare effectively.

**Key Issues:**
- 3,000+ ETFs in the market with complex documentation
- Generic investment advice that doesn't consider personal goals
- Manual research requiring hours to analyze single ETF
- Financial jargon and data overload preventing informed decisions

## Solution

I built ETFProfiler, an intelligent AI agent powered by LangGraph that conducts conversational interviews to understand investor preferences, then analyzes hundreds of ETF documents to provide personalized recommendations.

**Core AI Capabilities:**
- **üß† Conversational Profiling:** Interactive questioning to understand investment style and goals
- **üìÑ Document Intelligence:** Automated parsing and embedding of ETF factsheets and prospectuses
- **üß≠ LLM-Powered Matching:** GPT-4 interprets and scores ETFs based on user compatibility
- **üîç Semantic Retrieval:** ChromaDB surfaces most relevant ETF documents before analysis
- **üõ†Ô∏è LangGraph Architecture:** Fully transparent, debuggable workflow with customizable nodes

**Technical Implementation:**
Python, LangGraph, GPT-4, ChromaDB, Vector Embeddings, PDF Processing

**Additional Impact:**
- Automated analysis of complex 50+ page ETF prospectuses
- Natural language interface accessible to non-financial professionals
- Fully transparent decision-making process through LangGraph visualization

## Key Innovations

**LangGraph Workflow Architecture:**
Designed a transparent, node-based AI workflow where each step (profiling, document retrieval, scoring, recommendation) is a separate, debuggable component.

**Conversational Investment Profiling:**
Built an intelligent questioning system that adapts based on user responses, extracting nuanced investment preferences through natural conversation.

**Multi-Document Semantic Analysis:**
Implemented vector embedding system that processes hundreds of ETF documents simultaneously, enabling semantic search across complex financial information.

**Explainable AI Recommendations:**
Created transparent scoring system where users can see exactly why each ETF was recommended, building trust through explainability.

## Technical Architecture

- **AI Framework**: LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- **Language Model**: GPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for semantic document retrieval
- **Document Processing**: Python libraries for PDF parsing and text extraction
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI embeddings for semantic similarity matching
- **Development**: Python for rapid prototyping and experimentation

## Open Source & GitHub

**Repository**: [View ETFProfiler Source Code ‚Üí](https://github.com/nikpalumbo/etf-profiler)
