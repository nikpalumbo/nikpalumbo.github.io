## 🚀 Quick Start

### Starting the Development Server

Due to Ruby/bundler version conflicts on macOS, use Docker to run the Jekyll server:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/srv/jekyll" -p 4000:4000 -p 35729:35729 jekyll/jekyll:4.2.0 jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --livereload
```

**What this does:**
- Starts Jekyll server on `http://localhost:4000`
- Enables live reload on port 35729
- Automatically rebuilds when you make changes
- Bypasses local Ruby/bundler version issues

**To stop the server:** Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

**Alternative (if you fix bundler):** `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
